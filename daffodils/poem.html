    <h1 style="color: blue;">Daffodils</h1>
    <h5>by William Wordsworth</h5>
   
    <pre style="color: rgb(42, 48, 235);">
I wandered lonely as a child
That floats on high o'er and hills,
when all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Besides the lake, beneath the trees,     
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. <br>
Continuous as the stars that shine 
And twinkle on the milky way, 
They streched in never-ending line 
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance 
Tossing their in sptightly dance. <br>
The waves besides them danced, but they 
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed--and gazed--but little thought
what wealth the shoe to me had brought: <br>
For oft, when on my way couch I lie 
In vacant or in pensive mood, 
They flash upon that inward eye 
Which is the bliss of soltitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills, 
And dances with the daffodils
